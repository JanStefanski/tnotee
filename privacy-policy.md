TnoTee ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our note-taking application ("Application").

### Information Collection and Use

Our Application is designed to be used as a standalone service without the need for an internet connection. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or note content. All data is stored locally on your device, and we do not have access to this information.

### Data Storage

All notes and data created within the Application are stored directly on your device. We do not store any data on external servers, nor do we have access to the content you create. Your data remains under your control, and it is your responsibility to manage and backup your data as needed.

Our Application does not require an internet connection to function. As such, we do not collect any data related to your internet usage, IP address, or online activities. The Application operates independently on your device, ensuring complete privacy and security of your data.

### Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since we do not collect or store any data, there is no information to share or disclose to third parties. Your notes and information remain private and are not accessible to anyone but you.

### Security

We prioritize the security of your data on your device. However, as all information is stored locally, the security of your data is also dependent on the measures you take to secure your device. We recommend that you use strong passwords, encryption, and other security features available on your device to protect your data.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting the information you create with our Application.
